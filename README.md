Spectral disentangling using MCMC optimization with [FDBinary](http://sail.zpf.fer.hr/fdbinary/).\
Spectral disentangling is a mathematical method for obtaining the spectra of the component stars that make up spectral binary star systems. The radial velocities of the components in each observation are calculated and then a radial velocity correction is performed.

The method uses orbital parameters of the binary system. This parameters are; orbital period of binary system **P**, periastron passage **T0**, eccentricity of orbit **e**, longitude of periastron **Ï‰** and radial velocities of components **K1**,**K2**. [FDBinary](http://sail.zpf.fer.hr/fdbinary/), performs a orbit simulation using these parameters and calculates the velocities of the components for each observation. An optimization routine is needed to determine the parameters most accurately. FDBinary using [Downhill - Simplex Method](https://people.duke.edu/~hpgavin/cee201/Nelder+Mead-ComputerJournal-1965.pdf) for optimization. This routine is have some problems and cannot perform error analysis.
\
\
FDMC is a code written to solve this problem. Uses FDBinary for spectral disentangling and uses MCMC algorithm for parameter optimization. MCMC is to strong optimization routine and can perform error analysis with Bayesian statictic. FDMC is work on Linux systems and can work multiprocess. It stores the result of each iteration in it and this makes analysis easier.

FDMC using [corner plot](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303872046_cornerpy_Scatterplot_matrices_in_Python/fulltext/5a2cd23ba6fdccfbbf8746e5/cornerpy-Scatterplot-matrices-in-Python.pdf) for error analysis. In this way, the distribution of parameters in optimization space can also be seen.
